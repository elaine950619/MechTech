    "### Objectives ###\n",
    "* Data Ingestion: Fetch financial news articles using a public news API.\n",
    "* Sentiment Analysis: Utilize NLTK's VADER to calculate sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral, compound) based solely on the headlines.\n",

    "* **Data Parsing Errors:** If the publication date is not in ISO format, adjust the date parsing logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Performance and Challenges \n",
    "### Pipeline Performance\n",
    "**Overall Runtime and Throughput**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The entire pipeline completed in approximately *6.5 seconds* for processing *50 articles*.\n",
    "* This results in an average throughput of around *7.7 articles* per second, which demonstrates that the pipeline efficiently handles data ingestion, sentiment analysis, and database insertion in a relatively short period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase-by-Phase Breakdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Ingestion: \n",
    "    * **Time Taken:** ~2.0 seconds\n",
    "    * **Memory Utilization:** Memory increased by about 10 MB during the ingestion process.\n",
    "    * **Notes:** The API call successfully fetched the articles without major delays.\n",
    "* Sentiment Analysis:\n",
    "    * **Time Taken:** ~1.5 seconds\n",
    "    * **Memory Utilization:** An additional 5 MB of memory was used during the sentiment analysis phase.\n",
    "    * **Notes:** Using NLTK’s VADER, the sentiment analysis was performed quickly on each article headline.\n",
    "* Database Insertion:\n",
    "    * **Time Taken:** ~3.0 seconds\n",
    "    * **Memory Utilization:** Memory increased by roughly 2 MB during the database insertion stage.\n",
    "    * **Notes:** Insertion into PostgreSQL was efficient, with proper handling of date parsing and error management.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reliability and Efficiency:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The pipeline has been executed multiple times with consistent results, showing a high level of reliability.\n",
    "* Comprehensive error handling and logging were incorporated, ensuring that any issues in data parsing or database connectivity are captured and can be quickly addressed.\n",
    "* The moderate memory increases observed in each phase indicate that resource utilization is well-managed, leaving room for scaling if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "Overall, the performance of the pipeline is strong. The processing speed and throughput are suitable for handling a moderate number of articles, and the resource utilization remains within acceptable limits. Future improvements might include further optimization for handling larger volumes of data and integrating more sophisticated error monitoring tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges Faced\n",
    "* API Data Issues:\n",
    "    * **Inconsistencies:** Some API responses returned unexpected date formats or missing data.\n",
    "    * **Resolution:** Implemented robust error checking and conditional parsing for the publishedAt field (using datetime.fromisoformat() and fallback procedures).\n",
    "* Database Connectivity:\n",
    "    * **Connection Errors:** Initially encountered so many issues with connecting to the PostgreSQL database due to incorrect credentials and  connection settings.\n",
    "    * **Resolution:** Verified and updated connection parameters, and ensured the PostgreSQL service was running. Added exception handling around database operations.\n",
    "* Sentiment Analysis Edge Cases:\n",
    "    * **Data Quality:** Some headlines contained special characters or abbreviations that slightly skewed the sentiment results.\n",
    "    * **Resolution:** Implemented basic text pre-processing and normalization steps, such as removing extraneous characters and standardizing text inputs."
